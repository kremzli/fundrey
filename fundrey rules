Breaking any rule “as a joke” is still considered to be breaking that rule.
Anything posted under your account is your responsibility, so be sure to keep your account secure and do not let other people use it.
All message edits and deletions, and certain other user activity are logged. These logs are only accessible to the moderation team.

**2. Do Not Spam.**
This includes long or repetitive messages, copypasta, excessive use of emojis or gifs, emoji trains, empty lines, flashing images.

This is an English-Only server outside of the foreign-chat. Avoid excessive swearing.

**4. Channels.**
Keep discussions relevant to their respective channels. Keep controversial / heated topics in the vent channel.

**5. Advertising.**
